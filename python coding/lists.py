# list is a type of data structures in which we can store similar data type or any other data type 
# example l=[1,2,3]or l2=[1,'jenny',2,'ram',10.10] etc
# len(list) this funcyion gives the length of the list
# list.sort() this function is used to sort the list, first its sorted next it should be printed
# list.reverse() this fuction is used to reverse the list
# max(list) this function is used to print the maximum of the list
#  min(list) this function is used to print the minimum of the list
# you can access the each element of the list by its index 
# in list the first index is 0 and increases and -ve index exist , the last index is -1 and keeps decreases or increases in -ve manner
# in list u can do slicing list[1:3] this prints the elements with index 1 and prints upto len 3 i.e upto index 2
# list[1:5:3] here the elements printed with index 1 upto len 5 i.e upto index 4 with jumping of 3 elements in between
# in list u can add data dynamically
# list.append(ele) this function adds the given element at the last of the list
#in list u can add ele at particular index by using insert function "list.insert(index,ele)"
# in list to add more than one elemnt at the last extend function is used "list.extend([ele1,ele2,ele3])"
# list[index]=ele this removes previous ele of list and replace new ele
#list[1:4]=ele1,ele2,ele3 this replaces the previous elements with index 1,2,3 i.e  upto len 4 to new ele
# list.remove(ele) this function is used to remove the given ele from the list but it removes only 1st occurance
# list.pop() this fuction is used remove last element of the list
# list.pop(index) this function is used to remove ele at the given index
# list.count(ele) this gives the count of given ele in the list
# in list duplicate items are allowed
