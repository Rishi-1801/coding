# the for loop which is used in c,c++ is not same in python , here "for"  in python is more like iterator.
# iterator means running a loop for traversing into a sequence and doing given statements in it.
# syntax    for var_name in sequence:
#num=[2,4,6,8,10]
#square=[]
#for i in num:
#    s=i**2
#    square.append(s)
#print(" the squares of the numbers are: ",square)    
num=[1,2,3,4,5]
for i in num:
    print('*'*i) 




# there is one more known as for else.
# syntax     for var_name in sequence:
#                statements 
#            else:
#                 statements 
# the else part statements are printed if loop is successfully completed
#example
#num=[1,2,3,4,5]
#for i in num:
#    print('*'*i)
#else :
#   print("loop is successfully completed")
