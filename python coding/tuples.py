# the tuples are also similar to list but difference is brackets () these are used in tuples instead of []
t=(10,1,'rishi',-1)
print(t)
#the are immputable , the ele cannot be added or changed example below
#t[1]=3 this line gives error that  is type error
# in tupels duplicate items are allowed
# in tuples slicing is possible
# by len() u can know length of tuple
#nesting pof tuples are possible
#in tuple min() gives minimum
#in tuple max() gives maximum
# in tuple.count(ele)  gives the count of that ele
# we can convert a list into tuple by exapmle
#l=[1,2,3]
#print(tuple(l)) 
#in tuples if t=(10,)*5 prints (10,10,10,10,10)
